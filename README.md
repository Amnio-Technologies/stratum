# What is amnIO?

amnIO is a modular, open-source electronics lab instrument designed to provide students, makers, and engineers with a portable, cloud-connected alternative to traditional lab equipment. It combines the functionality of an oscilloscope, waveform generator, and power supply into a compact, user-friendly system with hot-swappable modules. Unlike conventional lab tools, amnIO plans to integrate modern UI design, cloud storage, and real-time collaboration features, making it easier to use in university labs, maker spaces, and personal workbenches.
